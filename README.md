Algorithms related to theory - ones we need to know

The algorithms in this repository are ones related to the course. 
They include searching and sorting algorithms, data structures and others specified in the syllabus.

The algortihms are there to be improved, and or applied in a range of languages or contexts.

For instance we may have a basic tree structure but we will also have versions that may be applied to a range of scenarios.
